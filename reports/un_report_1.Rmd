This report was prepared to the attention of the UN. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy, and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a country's economic strength or weakness is related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with the country's GDP.
