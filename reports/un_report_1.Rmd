This report was prepared to the attention of the UN. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy, and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a country's economic strength or weakness is related to its public health status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize that both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with the country's GDP.

```{r data, include = FALSE}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv(here("data/gapminder_1997.csv"))
```

```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997, 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
           color = continent, size = pop/1000000)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita",
       y= "Life Expectancy",
       title = "Do people in wealthy countries live longer?",
       size = "Population (in millions)")
```

```{r summary_stats, include = FALSE}
n_countries <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()
  
minimum_gdp <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarize(min(gdpPercap)) %>%
  round(digits = 1)

maximum_gdp <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarize(max(gdpPercap)) %>%
  round(digits = 1)

# format - will format things nicely
```

The above plot shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy for a total of `r n_countries` countries. For this set of countries, economic wealth ranged from a minimum of \$`r minimum_gdp` to a maximum of \$`r maximum_gdp` per capita.
